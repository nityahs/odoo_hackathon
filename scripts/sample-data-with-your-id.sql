    'For Next.js authentication, I highly recommend **NextAuth.js** (now called Auth.js). It''s the most popular and well-maintained solution.

Here''s why:

### Pros of NextAuth.js:
- üîê Built specifically for Next.js
- üåê Supports 50+ OAuth providers
- üõ°Ô∏è Security best practices built-in
- üìß Email/password authentication
- üîÑ Automatic JWT/session handling

### Basic Setup:
```bash
npm install next-auth
```

```javascript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google"

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    })
  ],
})
```

### Alternative Options:
- **Supabase Auth** - Great for full-stack apps
- **Auth0** - Enterprise-grade solution
- **Clerk** - Modern developer experience

For most Next.js projects, NextAuth.js is the way to go!',
